# **Term 3 Project 1: Path Planning Project**
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program

The goals of this project are the following:

* Implement a path planner that is able to create smooth, safe paths for the car to follow along a 3 lane highway with traffic
* Using locaalization, sensor fusion and map data, the path planner will be able to keep the car inside its lane, avoid hitting other cars, and pass slower moving traffic
* The car is able to drive at least 4.32 miles without incident
* The car drives according to the speed limit
* The car does not exceed a total acceleration of 10 m/s^2 and a jerk of 10 m/s^3
* Car does not have collisions
* The car doesn't spend more than a 3 second length out side the lane lanes during changing lanes, and every other time the car stays inside one of the 3 lanes on the right hand side of the road
